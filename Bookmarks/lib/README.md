This is a repository for going over material in the course where I felt i could do a better job.

The first of the material is the Bookmarks manager which i will build using Ruby and rspec.


User stories for a bookmark manager:

As a user, so that i can see what bookmarks i have, i need to be able to see a list of them.

As a user, so that i can create new bookmarks, i need to be able to have an add bookmark function. 

As a user, so that i can get rid of bookmarks, i need to be able to delete them.

As a user, so that i can correct errors, i need to be able to update bookmarks.

As a user, so that i can add more information to bookmarks, i need to be able to comment on them.

As a user, so that i can sort my bookmarks, i need to be able to tag them.

As a user, so that i can filer my bookmarks, i need to be able to sort them by tag.

As a user, so that i can keep my privacy, no other users should be able to see my bookmarks.
